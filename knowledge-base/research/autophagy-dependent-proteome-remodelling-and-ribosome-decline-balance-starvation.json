  "abstract": "Animals facing fluctuating food availability must balance survival during starvation with rapid resumption of growth when encountering food. We investigated how proteome turnover and remodelling through autophagy influences this trade-off in C. elegans L1 larvae by combining live imaging and proteomics. Starvation triggered an autophagy-dependent, disproportionate loss of ribosomal and other growth-related proteins. Residual ribosomal protein abundance at the end of starvation predicted the rate of growth recovery of individual animals during post-starvation feeding, linking proteome-scale changes to organism-scale life-history. Hyperactivation of the mTORC1 regulator RAGA-1 preserved ribosomal proteins, accelerated recovery after short starvation, but reduced survival under prolonged starvation. These findings identify autophagy-dependent ribosomal protein decline as a central component of starvation-induced proteome remodelling and reveal its role in balancing the trade-off between starvation endurance and recovery speed in a multicellular animal.",
