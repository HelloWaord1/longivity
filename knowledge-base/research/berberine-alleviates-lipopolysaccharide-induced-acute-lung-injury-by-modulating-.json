  "abstract": "The activation of adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by berberine (BBR) benefits various inflammatory diseases. Conversely, high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), typically exerts opposing effects. This research aims to investigate the relationship between AMPK and HMGB1, elucidating the functions and underlying mechanisms by which BBR alleviates acute lung injury (ALI) caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",
