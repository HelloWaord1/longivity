  "title": "Vitamin D and Older Adults: To Supplement or Not to Supplement?",
  "abstract": "The aging population is steadily increasing, representing a significant portion of the global population. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent, particularly among older adults and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases. In June 2024, a clinical practice guideline was published by the Endocrine Society, recommending empiric vitamin D supplementation for those over 75 years old, suggesting that it could reduce mortality in this age group. Meanwhile, for the general population aged 50-74 years, not only was empiric supplementation not suggested but neither was routine testing of vitamin D levels. This review discusses the pathophysiological changes associated with aging, the conditions commonly affecting older adults that may be positively impacted by vitamin D, and the potential negative effects of such supplementation. By examining the current knowledge in the field, we aim to provide practical insights into the effects of vitamin D in individuals older than 75 years and to explore the potential benefits of expanding supplementation to include younger older adults, specifically those aged 65-74 years.",
