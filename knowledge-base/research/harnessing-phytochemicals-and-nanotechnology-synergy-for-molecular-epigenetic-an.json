  "title": "Harnessing Phytochemicals and Nanotechnology Synergy for Molecular, Epigenetic, and Microbiota-Driven Regulation in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",
  "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifaceted metabolic disorder marked by impaired insulin action, pancreatic &#x3b2;-cell dysfunction, and the involvement of several interconnected mechanisms, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and epigenetic alterations. Despite progress in conventional therapies, achieving durable glycemic control and minimizing complications remain major challenges. This review discusses the emerging role of bioactive phytochemicals-such as curcumin, berberine, resveratrol, flavonoids, and polysaccharides-in modulating essential molecular pathways including AMPK, PI3K/AKT, and cAMP/PKA, which contribute to enhanced insulin sensitivity, glucose regulation, and &#x3b2;-cell protection. These natural compounds also influence gut microbiota modulation and epigenetic mechanisms, offering additional metabolic and anti-inflammatory benefits. This review synthesizes evidence from peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024, incorporating bibliometric trends showing an increasing research focus on phytochemicals for T2DM management. However, limitations such as low solubility, instability, and poor absorption restrict their clinical application. Advances in nanotechnology-based delivery systems, including nanoparticles, liposomes, and nanoemulsions, have shown potential to overcome these barriers by improving stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery of phytochemicals. The integration of gut microbiota modulation with nanocarrier-enabled phytochemical therapy supports a precision medicine approach for managing T2DM. Preliminary clinical evidence highlights significant improvements in glycemic control and inflammatory status, yet further large-scale, well-controlled trials are essential to ensure safety, optimize dosages, and standardize combination regimens. Overall, phytochemical therapies, reinforced by nanotechnology and microbiota modulation, present a promising, safe, and holistic strategy for T2DM management. Continued interdisciplinary research and clinical validation are crucial for translating these advances into effective therapeutic applications and reducing the global diabetes burden.",
