  "title": "Folate and global health umbrella review series, part 1: methodological framework and syntheses on anaemia and neural tube defects.",
  "abstract": "Folate is essential for normal growth and in human health throughout the lifecycle. Clinical deficiency of folate impairs DNA synthesis and results in megaloblastic anaemia, while suboptimal folate status before and in early pregnancy results in an elevated risk of neural tube defects (NTD). The evidence on the association of folate status with other health outcomes is largely fragmented and understudied. We conducted a series of umbrella reviews examining the association between folate and multiple health outcomes in various populations and settings.",
