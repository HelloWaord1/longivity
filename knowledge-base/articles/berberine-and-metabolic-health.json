  "body": "## Summary\n\nNew research sheds light on **Berberine & Metabolic Health** and its implications for healthy aging. We reviewed 2 recent studies exploring this topic — here's what the science says.\n\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **Berberine: A Negentropic Modulator for Multi-System Coordination:** Berberine (BBR), a protoberberine alkaloid with a long history of medicinal use, has consistently demonstrated benefits in glucose-lipid metabolism and inflammatory balance across both preclinical ...\n- **Berberine Alleviates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury by Modulating the AMPK-HMGB1-NF...:** The activation of adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by berberine (BBR) benefits various inflammatory diseases.\n\n## What This Means For You\n\nBerberine continues to demonstrate impressive metabolic benefits, activating AMPK — the body's \"metabolic master switch.\" Often compared to metformin, berberine may support glucose regulation, reduce inflammation, and modulate the gut microbiome. If you're looking for a natural approach to metabolic health, berberine is one of the most evidence-backed options.\n\n## Related Products\n\n- **Berberine** (Grade A) — 500mg 2-3x/day with meals\n  *Mechanisms:* AMPK activation, Glucose regulation, Gut microbiome, Lipid metabolism\n- **EGCG (Green Tea Extract)** (Grade B) — 400-500mg/day\n  *Mechanisms:* Autophagy induction, Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, AMPK activation\n- **Metformin** (Grade B) — 500-1000mg/day\n  *Mechanisms:* AMPK activation, mTOR inhibition, Glucose regulation\n\n## Sources\n\n- Berberine: A Negentropic Modulator for Multi-System Coordination *International journal of molecular sciences* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms27020747)\n- Berberine Alleviates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury by Modulating the AMPK-HMGB1-NF... *Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition)* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.31083/FBL45524)",
