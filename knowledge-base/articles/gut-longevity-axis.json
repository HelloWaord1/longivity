  "body": "## Summary\n\nThe nervous system modulates aging by secreting signaling molecules to cell-nonautonomously regulate the physiological state of distal tissues such as the gut.  However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.  Here, using C.\n\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **Temporally controlled nervous system-to-gut signaling bidirectionally regulates longevity in Caen...:** elegans as a model, we identified two distinct neuroendocrine signaling circuits through which motor neurons signal the gut in early life to shorten lifespan but in mid-late life to extend lifespan.\n\n## What This Means For You\n\nThe gut-brain-longevity axis is emerging as a central regulator of aging. Your gut microbiome communicates with your brain and influences everything from inflammation to metabolism to mood. Maintaining gut health through fiber, fermented foods, and targeted probiotics (like Akkermansia) may be one of the simplest ways to support healthy aging.\n\n## Related Products\n\n- **Akkermansia muciniphila** (Grade C) — 100mg (pasteurized) daily\n  *Mechanisms:* Gut barrier integrity, Metabolic health, Anti-inflammatory, Mucin layer support\n- **Berberine** (Grade A) — 500mg 2-3x/day with meals\n  *Mechanisms:* AMPK activation, Glucose regulation, Gut microbiome, Lipid metabolism\n- **BPC-157** (Grade D) — 250-500mcg/day (oral or injection)\n  *Mechanisms:* Tissue repair, Angiogenesis, Anti-inflammatory, Gut healing\n- **Collagen Peptides** (Grade B) — 10-15g/day\n  *Mechanisms:* Connective tissue support, Skin elasticity, Joint health, Gut lining\n\n## Sources\n\n- Temporally controlled nervous system-to-gut signaling bidirectionally regulates longevity in Caen... *bioRxiv (preprint)* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.12.589179)",
