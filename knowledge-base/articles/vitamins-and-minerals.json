  "body": "## Summary\n\nNew research sheds light on **Vitamins & Minerals** and its implications for healthy aging. We reviewed 2 recent studies exploring this topic — here's what the science says.\n\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **Folate and global health umbrella review series, part 1: methodological framework and syntheses o...:** We conducted a series of umbrella reviews examining the association between folate and multiple health outcomes in various populations and settings.\n- **Vitamin D and Older Adults: To Supplement or Not to Supplement?:** In June 2024, a clinical practice guideline was published by the Endocrine Society, recommending empiric vitamin D supplementation for those over 75 years old, suggesting that it could reduce morta...\n\n## What This Means For You\n\nEven in 2026, vitamin and mineral deficiencies remain surprisingly common and significantly impact health outcomes. These studies remind us that the foundation of any longevity protocol should include optimizing essential nutrients — particularly Vitamin D, folate, and key minerals. Testing your levels and supplementing accordingly is a simple, high-ROI strategy.\n\n## Related Products\n\n- **Magnesium (L-Threonate)** (Grade A) — 400-600mg elemental Mg/day\n  *Mechanisms:* Enzyme cofactor (300+ reactions), Sleep quality, Neuroprotective, Muscle relaxation\n- **Selenium** (Grade B) — 200mcg/day\n  *Mechanisms:* Glutathione peroxidase cofactor, Thyroid function, Anti-cancer, Antioxidant\n- **Vitamin D3 + K2** (Grade A) — D3: 2000-5000 IU/day, K2: 100-200mcg/day\n  *Mechanisms:* Immune modulation, Calcium metabolism, Gene expression, Bone health\n- **Zinc + Copper** (Grade A) — Zinc 15-30mg + Copper 1-2mg/day\n  *Mechanisms:* Immune function, Enzyme cofactor, DNA repair, Antioxidant (SOD)\n\n## Sources\n\n- Folate and global health umbrella review series, part 1: methodological framework and syntheses o... *Journal of global health* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.16.04014)\n- Vitamin D and Older Adults: To Supplement or Not to Supplement? *Drugs &amp; aging* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40266-025-01277-3)",
