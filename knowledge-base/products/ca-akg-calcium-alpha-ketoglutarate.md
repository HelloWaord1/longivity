# Ca-AKG (Calcium Alpha-Ketoglutarate)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Calcium salt of alpha-ketoglutarate, a key TCA cycle metabolite. The CALERIE-adjacent Rejuvant study showed biological age reversal. Supports epigenetic regulation via TET enzyme cofaction and collagen synthesis. Branded version: Rejuvant (ProHealthspan).

## Mechanisms of Action
- TCA cycle metabolite (energy production)
- TET enzyme cofactor (DNA demethylation)
- Collagen synthesis
- Stem cell maintenance

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1000mg/day
- **Range:** 500-2000mg/day
- **Notes:** Calcium alpha-ketoglutarate specific form. Take on empty stomach. Rejuvant brand is most studied. May take 4-7 months for measurable epigenetic changes.

## Key Findings
- Reduced biological age by 8 years in 7-month Rejuvant trial (TruAge)
- Extended lifespan ~12% in mice and reduced frailty (Buck Institute)
- AKG levels decline 10-fold between ages 40 and 80

## Interactions
- Calcium supplements (additive calcium intake)

## Side Effects
- Mild GI discomfort
- Constipation (calcium component)

## Contraindications
- Hypercalcemia
- Kidney stones (calcium-based)
