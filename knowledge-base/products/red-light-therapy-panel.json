  "description": "Photobiomodulation devices emitting red (630-670nm) and near-infrared (810-850nm) light. Stimulates mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, increasing ATP production and reducing oxidative stress. Studied for skin health, wound healing, pain reduction, and cognitive function.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Cytochrome c oxidase stimulation (Complex IV)",
    "ATP production increase",
    "Reactive oxygen species signaling (hormetic)",
    "Nitric oxide release and blood flow"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "10-20min per session, 5-10cm from panel, daily",
    "range": "5-30min, 3-7x/week",
    "notes": "Red (660nm) for skin/surface. NIR (850nm) penetrates deeper for joints, brain. Power density 50-100mW/cm². Quality panels: Joovv, Mito Red, Platinum LED."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "Improved skin complexion, collagen density, and wrinkle reduction in RCTs",
