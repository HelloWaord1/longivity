# Rhonda Patrick Protocol

**Category:** protocol
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Evidence-focused longevity approach by biomedical scientist Rhonda Patrick PhD (FoundMyFitness). Emphasizes micronutrient optimization, sulforaphane, omega-3, vitamin D, sauna, and exercise. Focuses on nutrient adequacy, genetic polymorphisms (e.g., MTHFR), and hormesis.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Micronutrient optimization
- Nrf2 pathway activation (sulforaphane)
- Omega-3 index optimization (8-12%)
- Heat shock protein induction (sauna)

## Dosage
- **Standard:** Sulforaphane (moringa/sprouts), Omega-3 (2-4g), Vitamin D (4000-5000 IU), Sauna 4x/week
- **Range:** Personalized based on genetics and blood work
- **Notes:** Strong emphasis on food-first approach. Smoothie with diverse micronutrients. Genetic testing to identify vulnerabilities. FoundMyFitness.com for latest protocols.

## Key Findings
- Omega-3 index >8% associated with 5-year longer life expectancy
- Sauna 4-7x/week: 40% reduction in all-cause mortality (Laukkanen)
- Sulforaphane activates Nrf2 — upregulates hundreds of protective genes
