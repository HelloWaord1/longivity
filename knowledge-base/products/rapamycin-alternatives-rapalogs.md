# Rapamycin Alternatives (Rapalogs)

**Category:** pharmaceutical
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
Next-generation mTOR inhibitors and rapalogs designed for better tolerability than rapamycin. Includes everolimus (RTB101) and newer compounds specifically targeting mTORC1 over mTORC2 to reduce side effects while maintaining longevity benefits.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Selective mTORC1 inhibition
- Autophagy induction
- Immune function enhancement (low doses)
- Senescent cell regulation

## Dosage
- **Standard:** Variable by compound — physician-guided
- **Range:** Everolimus 0.5mg/week typical
- **Notes:** Prescription only. Replicel (RTB101/everolimus) showed immune enhancement in elderly at low dose. Goal: mTORC1 inhibition without mTORC2 suppression.

## Key Findings
- Low-dose everolimus enhanced immune response to flu vaccine in elderly by 20% (Mannick et al., Science Translational Medicine)
- More selective mTORC1 targeting may avoid rapamycin side effects
- RTB101 (everolimus derivative) in clinical trials for immune aging

## Interactions
- CYP3A4 substrates
- Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers
- Vaccines (may affect response)

## Side Effects
- Mouth sores
- Delayed wound healing
- Metabolic changes
- Infections (high doses)

## Contraindications
- Active infections
- Severe hepatic impairment
- Immunosuppressed patients
