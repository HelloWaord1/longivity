# Canagliflozin (SGLT2 Inhibitor)

**Category:** pharmaceutical
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
SGLT2 inhibitor that blocks glucose reabsorption in kidneys, causing glycosuria (glucose excretion in urine). Extended lifespan in the NIA ITP. Beyond diabetes, shows remarkable cardio-renal protective effects and mimics aspects of caloric restriction.

## Mechanisms of Action
- SGLT2 inhibition (renal glucose excretion)
- Caloric restriction mimetic (~200-300 cal/day excreted)
- Ketogenesis promotion
- Cardiovascular and renal protection

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 100mg/day
- **Range:** 100-300mg/day
- **Notes:** Prescription. ITP-positive for lifespan extension. CREDENCE and CANVAS trials. Causes glycosuria — keep hydrated. Monitor for UTIs.

## Key Findings
- Extended lifespan in male mice in NIA ITP (genetically heterogeneous)
- CANVAS program: 14% reduction in cardiovascular events
- CREDENCE: 30% reduction in kidney disease progression

## Interactions
- Insulin and sulfonylureas (hypoglycemia risk)
- Diuretics (volume depletion)
- Loop diuretics

## Side Effects
- Genital mycotic infections (yeast)
- UTIs
- Polyuria
- Hypotension
- DKA (rare)

## Contraindications
- Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30)
- Type 1 diabetes
- Recurrent UTIs or genital infections
