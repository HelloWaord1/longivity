# Time-Restricted Eating (Circadian)

**Category:** protocol
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Eating aligned with circadian rhythm — typically finishing food 3+ hours before sleep and emphasizing earlier eating window. Distinct from caloric restriction. Satchin Panda's research shows circadian-aligned eating improves metabolic health independent of calorie reduction.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Circadian clock alignment
- Metabolic gene expression optimization
- Improved insulin sensitivity (morning > evening)
- Gut microbiome circadian rhythm support

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 10-12 hour eating window, finish 3hr before bed
- **Range:** 8-12 hour window
- **Notes:** Satchin Panda protocol: 10hr window is sweet spot for most. Earlier eating preferred (insulin sensitivity higher in AM). Even without calorie change, metabolic benefits observed. Track with myCircadianClock app.

## Key Findings
- 10hr TRE improved metabolic syndrome markers without calorie counting (Panda lab, Cell Metabolism)
- Firefighters on 10hr TRE: improved blood pressure, glucose, and LDL (RCT)
- Circadian misalignment (eating late) increases cancer risk independent of calories

## Interactions


## Side Effects
- Initial hunger during adjustment
- Social eating challenges

## Contraindications
- Eating disorder history
- Type 1 diabetes (without medical supervision)
- Pregnancy
