  "description": "Semi-essential amino acid that declines dramatically with age. A landmark 2023 Science paper showed taurine supplementation extended lifespan in mice by 10-12% and improved healthspan across multiple systems. Higher \"longevity doses\" (1-6g) differ from typical supplement amounts.",

    "standard": "1-3g/day",
    "range": "1-6g/day",
    "notes": "Science 2023 paper used ~500-1000mg/kg in mice (human equivalent ~3-6g). Levels decline 80% with age. Take with meals. Very affordable."
