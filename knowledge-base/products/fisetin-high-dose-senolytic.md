# Fisetin (High-Dose Senolytic)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
High-dose fisetin protocol (500-2000mg) used intermittently as a senolytic to clear senescent cells. Distinct from daily low-dose use. The "senolytic hit" approach targets zombie cells during 1-3 day bursts, followed by weeks of clearance.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Senolytic — kills senescent cells via apoptosis
- Bcl-2 family inhibition in senescent cells
- PI3K/AKT pathway modulation
- SASP reduction

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1000-2000mg/day for 2 consecutive days, monthly
- **Range:** 500-2500mg over 1-3 days
- **Notes:** Senolytic dosing is HIGH and INTERMITTENT. Different from daily use. Take with fat (olive oil) for absorption. Mayo Clinic trial used 20mg/kg.

## Key Findings
- Most potent senolytic identified in natural compound screen (Mayo Clinic)
- AFFIRM-LITE trial: high-dose fisetin for senescent cell clearance
- Intermittent dosing allows immune clearance of dead senescent cells between rounds

## Interactions
- Blood thinners (high doses may affect platelet function)
- CYP3A4 substrates

## Side Effects
- GI discomfort at high doses
- Diarrhea
- Possible allergic reaction

## Contraindications
- Bleeding disorders
- Upcoming surgery
