# Molecular Hydrogen (H2)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Molecular hydrogen gas (H2) dissolved in water or inhaled. Selectively neutralizes hydroxyl radical (•OH) — the most cytotoxic ROS — without affecting beneficial signaling ROS. Small size allows penetration of all cellular compartments including mitochondria and nucleus.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Selective hydroxyl radical scavenging
- Nrf2 pathway activation
- Anti-inflammatory (NF-κB modulation)
- Mitochondrial membrane potential maintenance

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1-3 hydrogen-rich water tablets/day (1-3 ppm)
- **Range:** 0.5-5 ppm water, 1-3x/day
- **Notes:** Dissolve H2 tablet in water (500ml), drink quickly (H2 escapes). Or use hydrogen water generator. 1000+ published studies. Extremely safe — no known toxic dose.

## Key Findings
- 1000+ published studies with wide-ranging benefits
- Improved metabolic syndrome markers in double-blind RCT
- Selective antioxidant — only targets harmful •OH radical, preserves beneficial H2O2 and NO signaling

## Interactions
- None known

## Side Effects
- Essentially none reported

## Contraindications
- None known
