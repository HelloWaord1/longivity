# Melatonin (High-Dose Longevity)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Higher-dose melatonin (3-20mg) used specifically for longevity and anti-cancer purposes, distinct from low-dose sleep use. Acts as a potent mitochondrial antioxidant, immune modulator, and has direct anti-cancer properties via oncostatic mechanisms.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Mitochondrial antioxidant (concentrates in mitochondria)
- Oncostatic — inhibits cancer cell proliferation
- Telomerase regulation
- Autophagy induction at higher doses

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 5-10mg/night
- **Range:** 3-20mg/night
- **Notes:** Higher doses for longevity/anti-cancer distinct from sleep dose (0.3-1mg). Extended-release preferred. Take 1hr before bed.

## Key Findings
- 10mg dose showed anti-cancer effects as adjuvant therapy in multiple RCTs
- Concentrates in mitochondria — 10x more potent there than in cytosol
- Extended lifespan in multiple animal models at higher doses

## Interactions
- Immunosuppressants
- Blood thinners
- Diabetes medications (affects insulin sensitivity)

## Side Effects
- Morning grogginess
- Vivid dreams
- Possible hormone disruption at very high doses

## Contraindications
- Autoimmune conditions (may stimulate immune system)
- Depression (may worsen in some)
