  "category": "supplement",
  "evidenceGrade": "C",
  "riskProfile": "low",
  "description": "Active metabolite of berberine with 5x better bioavailability. Allows lower dosing with equivalent or superior glucose-lowering effects and fewer GI side effects. GlucoVantage is the branded form. Ideal for those who can't tolerate standard berberine doses.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "AMPK activation (same as berberine, better absorbed)",
    "Glucose transporter modulation",
    "Gut microbiome modulation",
    "Lipid metabolism improvement"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "100-200mg 2-3x/day with meals",
    "range": "100-300mg per dose",
    "notes": "5x better absorbed than berberine — use ~1/5 the dose. GlucoVantage brand most studied. Better GI tolerance than berberine. Take with carb-containing meals."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "5x greater bioavailability than standard berberine in pharmacokinetic studies",
    "Equivalent glucose-lowering at fraction of the dose",
    "Significantly fewer GI side effects than standard berberine"
  ],
  "interactions": [
    "CYP enzyme substrates (similar to berberine)",
    "Diabetes medications",
    "Metformin (use with caution)"
  ],
  "sideEffects": [
    "Mild GI effects (much less than berberine)",
    "Hypoglycemia risk with diabetes meds"

  "contraindications": [
    "Severe liver disease",
    "Concurrent metformin (without medical supervision)"
