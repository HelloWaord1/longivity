# Cold Plunge (Equipment)

**Category:** device
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Dedicated cold water immersion equipment maintaining water at 1-15°C. Provides consistent cold exposure for hormesis, brown fat activation, and mood enhancement. Ranges from simple ice barrels to chiller-equipped tubs with filtration.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Norepinephrine surge (2-3x baseline)
- Brown adipose tissue activation
- Cold shock proteins (RBM3)
- Vagal tone improvement

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 2-5min at 10-15°C, 3-5x/week
- **Range:** 1-15min, based on temperature and adaptation
- **Notes:** Colder = shorter. 11°C Huberman protocol. Do NOT warm up with hot shower after — let body reheat naturally for maximum brown fat effect.

## Key Findings
- 2-3x norepinephrine increase lasting hours (sustained mood/focus boost)
- Activated brown fat and increased metabolic rate in regular practitioners
- Cold shock protein RBM3 associated with neuroprotection and synaptogenesis

## Interactions


## Side Effects
- Cold shock response (initial)
- Hyperventilation risk
- Numbness

## Contraindications
- Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease
- Raynaud phenomenon (severe)
