# TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4)

**Category:** peptide
**Evidence Grade:** D
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
Synthetic fragment of thymosin beta-4, a naturally occurring peptide involved in tissue repair and regeneration. Widely used in biohacking and veterinary medicine for accelerating wound healing and reducing inflammation. Limited human clinical data but extensive animal research.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Tissue repair and regeneration
- Angiogenesis promotion
- Anti-inflammatory
- Actin regulation and cell migration

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 2.5mg twice weekly (injection)
- **Range:** 2-10mg/week
- **Notes:** Typically run in 4-6 week cycles. Subcutaneous injection. Not FDA approved for human use.

## Key Findings
- Promoted cardiac repair after myocardial infarction in animal models
- Accelerated wound healing and hair regrowth in preclinical studies
- Upregulates actin polymerization enabling cell migration to injury sites

## Interactions
- May interact with anticoagulants due to wound-healing effects

## Side Effects
- Injection site irritation
- Headache
- Lethargy

## Contraindications
- Active cancer (theoretical — promotes angiogenesis)
- Pregnancy
