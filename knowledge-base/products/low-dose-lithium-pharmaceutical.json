  "riskProfile": "low",
  "description": "Lithium at sub-therapeutic doses (150-300mcg to 5mg) for neuroprotection and longevity, far below psychiatric doses (600-1200mg). Population studies show lower all-cause mortality and dementia rates in regions with higher lithium in drinking water.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "GSK-3β inhibition",
    "Autophagy induction (TFEB activation)",
    "BDNF upregulation",
    "Neuroprotective — reduces neuroinflammation"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "1-5mg lithium orotate daily",
    "range": "150mcg-20mg/day",
    "notes": "Sub-therapeutic dose — NOT psychiatric dosing. Lithium orotate preferred (better CNS penetration at low doses). No blood level monitoring needed at these doses."

  "keyFindings": [
    "Higher lithium in drinking water associated with lower suicide, dementia, and all-cause mortality",
