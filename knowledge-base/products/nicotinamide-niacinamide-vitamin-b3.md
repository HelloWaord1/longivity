Amide form of vitamin B3, distinct from niacin (no flushing). NAD+ precursor via the salvage pathway. Shown to reduce skin cancer risk and support DNA repair. Used in dermatology for photoprotection and in oncology for skin cancer prevention at 500mg 2x/day.

## Mechanisms of Action
- NAD+ precursor (salvage pathway)
- PARP enzyme support (DNA repair)
- Skin cancer prevention
- Anti-inflammatory (immune modulation)

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 500mg 2x/day
- **Range:** 250-1500mg/day
- **Notes:** Does NOT cause flushing (unlike niacin). ONTRAC trial dose: 500mg 2x/day for skin cancer prevention. Very affordable. Different mechanism from NMN/NR.
