# Dihydroberberine (GlucoVantage)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Active metabolite of berberine with 5x better bioavailability. Allows lower dosing with equivalent or superior glucose-lowering effects and fewer GI side effects. GlucoVantage is the branded form. Ideal for those who can't tolerate standard berberine doses.

## Mechanisms of Action
- AMPK activation (same as berberine, better absorbed)
- Glucose transporter modulation
- Gut microbiome modulation
- Lipid metabolism improvement

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 100-200mg 2-3x/day with meals
- **Range:** 100-300mg per dose
- **Notes:** 5x better absorbed than berberine — use ~1/5 the dose. GlucoVantage brand most studied. Better GI tolerance than berberine. Take with carb-containing meals.

## Key Findings
- 5x greater bioavailability than standard berberine in pharmacokinetic studies
- Equivalent glucose-lowering at fraction of the dose
- Significantly fewer GI side effects than standard berberine

## Interactions
- CYP enzyme substrates (similar to berberine)
- Diabetes medications
- Metformin (use with caution)

## Side Effects
- Mild GI effects (much less than berberine)
- Hypoglycemia risk with diabetes meds

## Contraindications
- Severe liver disease
- Concurrent metformin (without medical supervision)
