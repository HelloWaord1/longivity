  "description": "Synthetic dye and pharmaceutical with remarkable mitochondrial-enhancing properties at low doses. Acts as an alternative electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, bypassing Complex I/III dysfunction. Cognitive enhancer and neuroprotectant with over a century of medical use.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Alternative electron carrier (mitochondrial ETC bypass)",
    "Mitochondrial Complex IV optimization",
    "MAO-A inhibition (mood enhancement)",
    "Nrf2 activation and autophagy induction"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "0.5-2mg/kg (typically 15-50mg/day)",
    "range": "0.5-4mg/kg",
    "notes": "USP pharmaceutical grade essential (NOT industrial dye). Low doses enhance mitochondria, high doses inhibit them (hormetic U-curve). Will turn urine blue-green. Very affordable."
