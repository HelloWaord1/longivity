# TMG (Trimethylglycine / Betaine)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Methyl donor that supports the methionine-homocysteine cycle, helping to lower homocysteine and support SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) production. Important companion to NMN/NR supplementation to replenish methyl groups consumed in NAD+ metabolism.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Methyl group donation (homocysteine → methionine)
- SAM production support
- Liver health (lipotropic)
- Osmolyte function (cellular protection)

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 500-1000mg/day
- **Range:** 250-3000mg/day
- **Notes:** Essential co-supplement with NMN/NR to avoid methyl donor depletion. Also known as betaine (from beets). Take with meals. Very affordable.

## Key Findings
- Effectively lowers homocysteine levels (independent cardiovascular risk factor)
- Compensates for methyl group depletion from NAD+ precursor supplementation
- Protects against fatty liver disease in clinical studies

## Interactions
- Methotrexate
- Other methyl donors (folate, B12)

## Side Effects
- GI upset
- Fishy body odor (rare)
- Nausea at high doses

## Contraindications
- Homocystinuria (need medical supervision)
