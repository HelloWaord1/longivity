    "standard": "7-9 hours with consistent timing, cool dark room",
    "range": "7-9 hours",
    "notes": "Temperature: 65-68°F (18-20°C). Dark: blackout curtains. Timing: consistent wake time ±30min. Light: morning sunlight within 30min of waking. No screens 1hr before bed. Supplements if needed: Mg glycinate, L-theanine, apigenin."
