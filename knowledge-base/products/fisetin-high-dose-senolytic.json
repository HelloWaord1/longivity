  "description": "High-dose fisetin protocol (500-2000mg) used intermittently as a senolytic to clear senescent cells. Distinct from daily low-dose use. The \"senolytic hit\" approach targets zombie cells during 1-3 day bursts, followed by weeks of clearance.",

    "Senolytic — kills senescent cells via apoptosis",
    "Bcl-2 family inhibition in senescent cells",

  "dosage": {
    "standard": "1000-2000mg/day for 2 consecutive days, monthly",
    "range": "500-2500mg over 1-3 days",
    "notes": "Senolytic dosing is HIGH and INTERMITTENT. Different from daily use. Take with fat (olive oil) for absorption. Mayo Clinic trial used 20mg/kg."
