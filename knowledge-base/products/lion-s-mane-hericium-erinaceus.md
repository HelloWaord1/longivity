# Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Medicinal mushroom with unique neurotrophic properties. Contains hericenones and erinacines that stimulate Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) synthesis — the only known natural compounds to do so. Supports neurogenesis, cognition, and may protect against neurodegeneration.

## Mechanisms of Action
- NGF stimulation (hericenones and erinacines)
- BDNF upregulation
- Neurogenesis promotion
- Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 500-1000mg extract, 2x/day
- **Range:** 500-3000mg/day
- **Notes:** Dual extract (hot water + alcohol) captures both hericenones and erinacines. Fruiting body + mycelium combined preferred. Take consistently for 4+ weeks for cognitive effects.

## Key Findings
- Improved cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment (Mori et al., double-blind RCT)
- Stimulated NGF synthesis in human astrocyte cells
- Reduced anxiety and depression scores in menopausal women

## Interactions
- Blood thinners (mild antiplatelet effect)
- Diabetes medications (may lower blood sugar)

## Side Effects
- GI discomfort
- Skin rash (rare, in allergic individuals)

## Contraindications
- Mushroom allergy
- Pre-surgery (antiplatelet effect)
