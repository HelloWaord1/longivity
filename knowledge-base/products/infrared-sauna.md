# Infrared Sauna

**Category:** device
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Far-infrared (FIR) sauna panels that heat the body directly at lower ambient temperatures (40-65°C) compared to traditional Finnish saunas. Promotes detoxification, cardiovascular conditioning, and heat shock protein production with better tolerability.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Heat shock protein induction (HSP70, HSP90)
- Increased core body temperature
- Heavy metal and toxin excretion via sweat
- Cardiovascular conditioning (mimics moderate exercise)

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 30-45min at 55-65°C, 3-5x/week
- **Range:** 20-60min sessions
- **Notes:** Lower temperature than Finnish sauna but longer sessions. Far-infrared penetrates 1.5 inches into tissue. Hydrate well. Mineral supplementation recommended.

## Key Findings
- Similar cardiovascular benefits to Finnish sauna at more tolerable temperatures
- Improved symptoms in congestive heart failure patients (Waon therapy, Japan)
- Enhanced detoxification — heavy metals and BPA found in sweat at higher concentrations than blood

## Interactions
- Heat-sensitive medications
- Alcohol (dangerous combination)

## Side Effects
- Dehydration
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Lightheadedness

## Contraindications
- Unstable angina
- Recent heart attack
- Pregnancy
- Multiple sclerosis (heat-sensitive)
