# Methylene Blue (Low-Dose)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
Synthetic dye and pharmaceutical with remarkable mitochondrial-enhancing properties at low doses. Acts as an alternative electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, bypassing Complex I/III dysfunction. Cognitive enhancer and neuroprotectant with over a century of medical use.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Alternative electron carrier (mitochondrial ETC bypass)
- Mitochondrial Complex IV optimization
- MAO-A inhibition (mood enhancement)
- Nrf2 activation and autophagy induction

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 0.5-2mg/kg (typically 15-50mg/day)
- **Range:** 0.5-4mg/kg
- **Notes:** USP pharmaceutical grade essential (NOT industrial dye). Low doses enhance mitochondria, high doses inhibit them (hormetic U-curve). Will turn urine blue-green. Very affordable.

## Key Findings
- Enhanced memory and cognitive function in animal and small human studies
- Improved mitochondrial function in aged neurons
- FDA-approved (high dose) for methemoglobinemia — century of safety data at clinical doses

## Interactions
- SSRIs and serotonergic drugs (SEROTONIN SYNDROME RISK — serious)
- MAO inhibitors (CONTRAINDICATED)
- Psychiatric medications

## Side Effects
- Blue-green urine and stool
- Blue-tinged skin/sclera
- Nausea
- Serotonin syndrome with SSRIs

## Contraindications
- SSRI/SNRI use (DANGEROUS — serotonin syndrome)
- MAO inhibitor use
- G6PD deficiency (hemolytic anemia)
- Severe renal impairment
