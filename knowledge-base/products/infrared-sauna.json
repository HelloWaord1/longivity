  "description": "Far-infrared (FIR) sauna panels that heat the body directly at lower ambient temperatures (40-65°C) compared to traditional Finnish saunas. Promotes detoxification, cardiovascular conditioning, and heat shock protein production with better tolerability.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Heat shock protein induction (HSP70, HSP90)",
    "Increased core body temperature",
    "Heavy metal and toxin excretion via sweat",
    "Cardiovascular conditioning (mimics moderate exercise)"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "30-45min at 55-65°C, 3-5x/week",
    "range": "20-60min sessions",
    "notes": "Lower temperature than Finnish sauna but longer sessions. Far-infrared penetrates 1.5 inches into tissue. Hydrate well. Mineral supplementation recommended."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "Similar cardiovascular benefits to Finnish sauna at more tolerable temperatures",
    "Improved symptoms in congestive heart failure patients (Waon therapy, Japan)",
    "Enhanced detoxification — heavy metals and BPA found in sweat at higher concentrations than blood"
  ],
  "interactions": [
    "Heat-sensitive medications",
    "Alcohol (dangerous combination)"
  ],
  "sideEffects": [
    "Dehydration",
    "Electrolyte imbalance",
    "Lightheadedness"

  "contraindications": [
    "Unstable angina",
