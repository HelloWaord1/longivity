# GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide)

**Category:** peptide
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
A naturally occurring copper-binding tripeptide that declines with age. Extensive research shows it remodels tissue, stimulates collagen and glycosaminoglycans, has anti-inflammatory effects, and may reset gene expression toward a younger pattern.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Collagen and elastin synthesis
- Stem cell attraction to injury sites
- Gene expression reset (resets ~30% of genes to younger pattern)
- Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1-2ml of 0.1% solution topical, or 200mcg injection
- **Range:** Topical or 100-500mcg SC
- **Notes:** Topical for skin/hair. Subcutaneous injection for systemic effects. Naturally present in plasma at ~200ng/ml in youth.

## Key Findings
- Resets expression of ~30% of human genes toward a younger state (Pickart)
- Improved wound healing, skin thickness, and hair growth in clinical studies
- Plasma levels decline from 200ng/ml (age 20) to 80ng/ml (age 60)

## Interactions
- Copper supplements — monitor copper levels

## Side Effects
- Skin irritation (topical)
- Injection site redness

## Contraindications
- Wilson disease (copper metabolism disorder)
- Active liver disease
