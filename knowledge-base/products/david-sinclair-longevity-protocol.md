# David Sinclair Longevity Protocol

**Category:** protocol
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Protocol based on research by Harvard geneticist David Sinclair (author of "Lifespan"). Centers on the Information Theory of Aging — epigenetic noise accumulation. Core stack: NMN, resveratrol, metformin, with intermittent fasting and cold/heat exposure.

## Mechanisms of Action
- NAD+ replenishment (NMN)
- Sirtuin activation (resveratrol + NMN)
- AMPK activation (metformin)
- Epigenetic reprogramming support

## Dosage
- **Standard:** NMN 1g, Resveratrol 1g (with yogurt), Metformin 1g (evening)
- **Range:** Variable — he adjusts based on bloodwork
- **Notes:** Sinclair has publicly shared his personal protocol. Resveratrol with fat source in morning. NMN morning. Metformin evening (skip on exercise days). Plus vitamin D, K2, aspirin, TMG.

## Key Findings
- Sinclair lab: NMN restored NAD+ levels and improved healthspan in aged mice
- ICE mice: epigenetic reprogramming reversed aging (Sinclair lab, Cell 2023)
- Controversial — some peers dispute extrapolation from mouse to human data

## Interactions
- Complex multi-drug protocol — interaction mapping important

## Side Effects
- Metformin GI side effects
- Cost of NMN

## Contraindications
- Metformin contraindications apply
- Individual variation in response
