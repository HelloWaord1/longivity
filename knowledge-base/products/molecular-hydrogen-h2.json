  "description": "Molecular hydrogen gas (H2) dissolved in water or inhaled. Selectively neutralizes hydroxyl radical (•OH) — the most cytotoxic ROS — without affecting beneficial signaling ROS. Small size allows penetration of all cellular compartments including mitochondria and nucleus.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Selective hydroxyl radical scavenging",

  "dosage": {
    "standard": "1-3 hydrogen-rich water tablets/day (1-3 ppm)",
    "range": "0.5-5 ppm water, 1-3x/day",
    "notes": "Dissolve H2 tablet in water (500ml), drink quickly (H2 escapes). Or use hydrogen water generator. 1000+ published studies. Extremely safe — no known toxic dose."
