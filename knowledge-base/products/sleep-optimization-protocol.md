# Sleep Optimization Protocol

**Category:** protocol
**Evidence Grade:** A
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Comprehensive evidence-based sleep optimization combining environment, behavior, timing, and optional supplementation. Sleep is the foundation of all longevity — poor sleep accelerates every aging pathway. Based on Matthew Walker's research and Andrew Huberman's protocols.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Glymphatic clearance (brain waste removal during sleep)
- Growth hormone secretion (deep sleep)
- Immune system restoration
- Memory consolidation and emotional processing

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 7-9 hours with consistent timing, cool dark room
- **Range:** 7-9 hours
- **Notes:** Temperature: 65-68°F (18-20°C). Dark: blackout curtains. Timing: consistent wake time ±30min. Light: morning sunlight within 30min of waking. No screens 1hr before bed. Supplements if needed: Mg glycinate, L-theanine, apigenin.

## Key Findings
- Sleeping <6hr doubles cardiovascular disease and cancer risk
- Glymphatic system clears amyloid beta 10x more during sleep
- Consistent sleep schedule more important than total sleep duration
