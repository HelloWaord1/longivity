# Comprehensive Blood Biomarker Panel

**Category:** diagnostic
**Evidence Grade:** A
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Extended blood panel covering metabolic, hormonal, inflammatory, and organ function markers. Goes beyond standard annual bloodwork to include longevity-relevant biomarkers like insulin, hs-CRP, homocysteine, ApoB, and hormone panels.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Metabolic health assessment (glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipids)
- Inflammation markers (hs-CRP, homocysteine, IL-6)
- Hormone levels (testosterone, estradiol, thyroid, cortisol)
- Organ function (liver, kidney, complete blood count)

## Dosage
- **Standard:** Fasting blood draw, every 3-6 months
- **Range:** Quarterly to annually
- **Notes:** Best done fasting (12hr). Include: CBC, CMP, lipid panel + ApoB, insulin, HbA1c, hs-CRP, homocysteine, full thyroid, hormones, vitamin D, B12, ferritin.

## Key Findings
- Regular monitoring enables data-driven intervention optimization
- ApoB superior to LDL-C for cardiovascular risk assessment
- Fasting insulin is earliest marker of metabolic dysfunction
