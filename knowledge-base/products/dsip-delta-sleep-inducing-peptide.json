  "description": "A neuropeptide originally isolated from rabbit brain that promotes delta wave sleep. Research suggests roles in stress modulation, pain perception, and endocrine regulation. Limited but intriguing clinical data from European studies.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Delta wave sleep induction",
    "Cortisol and stress modulation",
    "LH/GH release regulation",
    "Opioid system modulation"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "100-300mcg before bed (intranasal or injection)",
    "range": "100-500mcg",
    "notes": "Short half-life. Typically used for 2-4 week cycles. Intranasal or subcutaneous."
  },
