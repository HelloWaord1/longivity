# Red Light Therapy Panel

**Category:** device
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Photobiomodulation devices emitting red (630-670nm) and near-infrared (810-850nm) light. Stimulates mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, increasing ATP production and reducing oxidative stress. Studied for skin health, wound healing, pain reduction, and cognitive function.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Cytochrome c oxidase stimulation (Complex IV)
- ATP production increase
- Reactive oxygen species signaling (hormetic)
- Nitric oxide release and blood flow

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 10-20min per session, 5-10cm from panel, daily
- **Range:** 5-30min, 3-7x/week
- **Notes:** Red (660nm) for skin/surface. NIR (850nm) penetrates deeper for joints, brain. Power density 50-100mW/cm². Quality panels: Joovv, Mito Red, Platinum LED.

## Key Findings
- Improved skin complexion, collagen density, and wrinkle reduction in RCTs
- Reduced joint pain and inflammation comparable to NSAIDs in some trials
- Enhanced cognitive function and reduced TBI symptoms (Naeser et al.)

## Interactions
- Photosensitizing medications

## Side Effects
- Temporary skin warmth
- Eye strain (use goggles)
- Rare: headache

## Contraindications
- Active cancer over treatment area (theoretical)
- Photosensitivity disorders
- Over thyroid if hyperthyroid
