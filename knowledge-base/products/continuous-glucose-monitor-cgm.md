# Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)

**Category:** device
**Evidence Grade:** A
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Wearable sensor (usually on arm) that continuously tracks interstitial glucose levels, providing real-time data on metabolic health. Reveals hidden glucose spikes from foods, exercise, stress, and sleep. Key tool for metabolic optimization even in non-diabetics.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Real-time glucose monitoring (every 1-5 min)
- Pattern recognition for food responses
- Glucose variability tracking
- Metabolic health optimization feedback

## Dosage
- **Standard:** Continuous wear, 14-day sensor
- **Range:** Ongoing or periodic 1-3 month experiments
- **Notes:** Major brands: Dexcom G7, Abbott Freestyle Libre 3, Stelo (OTC). Non-diabetics: use for 1-3 months to learn personal responses, then periodically recheck.

## Key Findings
- Reveals individual glucose responses vary enormously to identical foods (Zeevi et al., Cell)
- Glucose variability (not just average) predicts cardiovascular risk
- Behavior change tool — users reduce glucose spikes 15-30% through real-time feedback

## Interactions
- High-dose vitamin C may interfere with readings
- Acetaminophen (older sensors)

## Side Effects
- Skin irritation at sensor site
- Adhesive allergy

## Contraindications
- Severe skin conditions at application site
