# Taurine (Longevity Dose)

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Semi-essential amino acid that declines dramatically with age. A landmark 2023 Science paper showed taurine supplementation extended lifespan in mice by 10-12% and improved healthspan across multiple systems. Higher "longevity doses" (1-6g) differ from typical supplement amounts.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Mitochondrial function support
- Anti-inflammatory (reduces oxidative stress)
- Osmotic regulation and calcium signaling
- Bile acid conjugation

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1-3g/day
- **Range:** 1-6g/day
- **Notes:** Science 2023 paper used ~500-1000mg/kg in mice (human equivalent ~3-6g). Levels decline 80% with age. Take with meals. Very affordable.

## Key Findings
- Extended median lifespan by 10-12% in mice (Singh et al., Science 2023)
- Blood taurine levels decline 80%+ from youth to old age
- Improved bone density, muscle endurance, immune function, and metabolic health in aged mice

## Interactions
- Lithium (taurine affects renal lithium clearance)

## Side Effects
- GI discomfort at very high doses
- Mild drowsiness

## Contraindications
- Bipolar disorder on lithium (monitor levels)
