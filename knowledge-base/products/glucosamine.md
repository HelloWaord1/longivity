# Glucosamine

**Category:** supplement
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Amino sugar traditionally used for joint health, but emerging large-scale epidemiological data shows remarkable association with reduced all-cause mortality (18-39% reduction), comparable to regular exercise. May work via mTOR pathway modulation.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Glycosaminoglycan precursor (cartilage)
- mTOR pathway modulation
- Anti-inflammatory
- Mimics low-carbohydrate state (hexosamine pathway)

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1500mg/day
- **Range:** 500-3000mg/day
- **Notes:** Glucosamine sulfate or HCl. Large UK Biobank studies showed mortality benefit. May mimic aspects of fasting via hexosamine pathway.

## Key Findings
- Regular users had 18-39% lower all-cause mortality in UK Biobank (500,000+ participants)
- Mortality reduction comparable to regular exercise in observational data
- May activate autophagy via hexosamine pathway — similar to fasting mimicry

## Interactions
- Warfarin (may enhance anticoagulant effect)
- Diabetes medications (monitor glucose)

## Side Effects
- GI discomfort
- Shellfish allergy concern (if shellfish-derived)

## Contraindications
- Shellfish allergy (use synthetic form)
- Diabetes (monitor glucose)
