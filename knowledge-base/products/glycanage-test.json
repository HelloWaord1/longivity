  "description": "Biological age test based on IgG glycosylation patterns. Measures the glycan structures attached to immunoglobulin G, which reflect chronic inflammation and immune system aging. Complementary to epigenetic clocks.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "IgG glycosylation analysis",
    "Inflammation status assessment",
    "Immune age measurement"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "Dried blood spot, test every 3-6 months",
    "range": "Quarterly to annually",
    "notes": "Simple finger-prick dried blood spot. Measures glycan age (can be older or younger than chronological age). Responsive to lifestyle changes."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "IgG glycans change predictably with age and inflammation",
    "Responsive to lifestyle interventions within 3-6 months (faster than methylation clocks)",
    "Validated across multiple cohorts (>100,000 individuals)"
