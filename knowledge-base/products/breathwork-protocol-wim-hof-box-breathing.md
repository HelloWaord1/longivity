# Breathwork Protocol (Wim Hof / Box Breathing)

**Category:** protocol
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Structured breathing practices for stress resilience, immune modulation, and autonomic nervous system control. Wim Hof Method combines cyclic hyperventilation with breath holds, while box breathing activates the parasympathetic system. Both have clinical evidence.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Autonomic nervous system control
- Epinephrine and norepinephrine modulation
- Immune system modulation (Wim Hof)
- CO2 tolerance training

## Dosage
- **Standard:** Wim Hof: 3 rounds of 30 breaths + hold, daily. Box: 4-4-4-4, 5-10min
- **Range:** 5-20 min/day
- **Notes:** Wim Hof Method: NEVER in water (drowning risk). Box breathing: 4sec inhale-hold-exhale-hold. Physiological sigh (double inhale, long exhale) for acute stress. Free and always available.

## Key Findings
- Wim Hof practitioners voluntarily modulated immune response to endotoxin (PNAS 2014)
- Box breathing reduced PTSD symptoms in veterans
- Cyclic hyperventilation increased epinephrine 2-3x (comparable to first-time bungee jump)
