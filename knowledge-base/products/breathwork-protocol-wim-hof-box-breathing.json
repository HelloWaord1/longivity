  "description": "Structured breathing practices for stress resilience, immune modulation, and autonomic nervous system control. Wim Hof Method combines cyclic hyperventilation with breath holds, while box breathing activates the parasympathetic system. Both have clinical evidence.",

  "dosage": {
    "standard": "Wim Hof: 3 rounds of 30 breaths + hold, daily. Box: 4-4-4-4, 5-10min",
    "range": "5-20 min/day",
    "notes": "Wim Hof Method: NEVER in water (drowning risk). Box breathing: 4sec inhale-hold-exhale-hold. Physiological sigh (double inhale, long exhale) for acute stress. Free and always available."
