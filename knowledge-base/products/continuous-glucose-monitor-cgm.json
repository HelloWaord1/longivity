  "description": "Wearable sensor (usually on arm) that continuously tracks interstitial glucose levels, providing real-time data on metabolic health. Reveals hidden glucose spikes from foods, exercise, stress, and sleep. Key tool for metabolic optimization even in non-diabetics.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Real-time glucose monitoring (every 1-5 min)",
    "Pattern recognition for food responses",
    "Glucose variability tracking",
    "Metabolic health optimization feedback"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "Continuous wear, 14-day sensor",
    "range": "Ongoing or periodic 1-3 month experiments",
    "notes": "Major brands: Dexcom G7, Abbott Freestyle Libre 3, Stelo (OTC). Non-diabetics: use for 1-3 months to learn personal responses, then periodically recheck."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "Reveals individual glucose responses vary enormously to identical foods (Zeevi et al., Cell)",
    "Glucose variability (not just average) predicts cardiovascular risk",
    "Behavior change tool — users reduce glucose spikes 15-30% through real-time feedback"
  ],
  "interactions": [
    "High-dose vitamin C may interfere with readings",
