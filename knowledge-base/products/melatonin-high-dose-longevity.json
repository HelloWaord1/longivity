  "riskProfile": "low",
  "description": "Higher-dose melatonin (3-20mg) used specifically for longevity and anti-cancer purposes, distinct from low-dose sleep use. Acts as a potent mitochondrial antioxidant, immune modulator, and has direct anti-cancer properties via oncostatic mechanisms.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Mitochondrial antioxidant (concentrates in mitochondria)",
    "Oncostatic — inhibits cancer cell proliferation",
    "Telomerase regulation",
    "Autophagy induction at higher doses"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "5-10mg/night",
    "range": "3-20mg/night",
    "notes": "Higher doses for longevity/anti-cancer distinct from sleep dose (0.3-1mg). Extended-release preferred. Take 1hr before bed."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "10mg dose showed anti-cancer effects as adjuvant therapy in multiple RCTs",
    "Concentrates in mitochondria — 10x more potent there than in cytosol",
    "Extended lifespan in multiple animal models at higher doses"
