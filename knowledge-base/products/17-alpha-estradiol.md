# 17-alpha Estradiol

**Category:** pharmaceutical
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
Non-feminizing enantiomer of estradiol that extended lifespan in male mice in the NIA ITP. Unlike 17-beta estradiol, it does not activate classical estrogen receptors significantly, avoiding feminizing effects. Mechanism likely involves metabolic and hypothalamic pathways.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Hypothalamic nutrient sensing modulation
- Hepatic lipid metabolism improvement
- Visceral fat reduction
- Non-classical estrogen signaling

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 4.8-14.4 ppm in diet (mouse dose — human equivalent uncertain)
- **Range:** Under investigation
- **Notes:** NIA ITP positive in males only. Human dosing not established. Available as compounded pharmaceutical. Mechanism distinct from classical estrogen receptor activation.

## Key Findings
- Extended lifespan 19% in male mice in NIA ITP (no effect in females)
- Did not feminize male mice — distinct from 17-beta estradiol
- Improved glucose tolerance and reduced visceral adiposity in male mice

## Interactions
- Unknown — limited human data
- Potentially liver-metabolized drugs

## Side Effects
- Unknown in humans at longevity doses
- Theoretical: mild estrogenic effects

## Contraindications
- Hormone-sensitive cancers
- Women (untested for longevity)
- Liver disease
