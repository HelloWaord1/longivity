  "description": "Dedicated cold water immersion equipment maintaining water at 1-15°C. Provides consistent cold exposure for hormesis, brown fat activation, and mood enhancement. Ranges from simple ice barrels to chiller-equipped tubs with filtration.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Norepinephrine surge (2-3x baseline)",
    "Brown adipose tissue activation",
    "Cold shock proteins (RBM3)",
    "Vagal tone improvement"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "2-5min at 10-15°C, 3-5x/week",
    "range": "1-15min, based on temperature and adaptation",
    "notes": "Colder = shorter. 11°C Huberman protocol. Do NOT warm up with hot shower after — let body reheat naturally for maximum brown fat effect."
