# Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber (HBOT)

**Category:** device
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
Pressurized chamber delivering 100% oxygen at 1.3-2.0 ATA. Increases dissolved oxygen in plasma, stimulates stem cell release, promotes angiogenesis, and has shown remarkable results in reversing biological aging markers in clinical trials.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Hyperoxia-hypoxia paradox (stem cell mobilization)
- Telomere lengthening
- Senescent cell clearance
- Angiogenesis and neuroplasticity

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 60-90min at 1.5-2.0 ATA, 2-5x/week
- **Range:** 40-120min sessions
- **Notes:** Clinical HBOT at 2.0 ATA requires prescription. Mild HBOT (1.3 ATA) available for home use. Tel Aviv protocol: 60 sessions for anti-aging.

## Key Findings
- Lengthened telomeres by 20-38% and cleared senescent cells by 11-37% (Hadanny 2020, Tel Aviv)
- Improved cognitive function in elderly with MCI in randomized trial
- FDA-approved for 14 conditions including wound healing and carbon monoxide poisoning

## Interactions
- Certain chemotherapy drugs
- Bleomycin (pulmonary toxicity risk)

## Side Effects
- Ear barotrauma
- Sinus pressure
- Temporary myopia
- Claustrophobia

## Contraindications
- Untreated pneumothorax
- Certain lung conditions
- Recent ear surgery
