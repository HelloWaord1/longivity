# DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide)

**Category:** peptide
**Evidence Grade:** D
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
A neuropeptide originally isolated from rabbit brain that promotes delta wave sleep. Research suggests roles in stress modulation, pain perception, and endocrine regulation. Limited but intriguing clinical data from European studies.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Delta wave sleep induction
- Cortisol and stress modulation
- LH/GH release regulation
- Opioid system modulation

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 100-300mcg before bed (intranasal or injection)
- **Range:** 100-500mcg
- **Notes:** Short half-life. Typically used for 2-4 week cycles. Intranasal or subcutaneous.

## Key Findings
- Improved sleep architecture and increased delta wave sleep in clinical studies
- Normalized disturbed sleep patterns without next-day sedation
- Showed stress-protective and analgesic properties in animal models

## Interactions
- May potentiate sedatives and sleep medications

## Side Effects
- Mild drowsiness
- Vivid dreams
- Nasal irritation (intranasal)

## Contraindications
- Severe respiratory depression
- Use of CNS depressants
