  "riskProfile": "low",
  "description": "Medicinal mushroom with unique neurotrophic properties. Contains hericenones and erinacines that stimulate Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) synthesis — the only known natural compounds to do so. Supports neurogenesis, cognition, and may protect against neurodegeneration.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "NGF stimulation (hericenones and erinacines)",
    "BDNF upregulation",
    "Neurogenesis promotion",
    "Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "500-1000mg extract, 2x/day",
    "range": "500-3000mg/day",
    "notes": "Dual extract (hot water + alcohol) captures both hericenones and erinacines. Fruiting body + mycelium combined preferred. Take consistently for 4+ weeks for cognitive effects."
