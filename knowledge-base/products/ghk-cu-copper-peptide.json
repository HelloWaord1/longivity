  "description": "A naturally occurring copper-binding tripeptide that declines with age. Extensive research shows it remodels tissue, stimulates collagen and glycosaminoglycans, has anti-inflammatory effects, and may reset gene expression toward a younger pattern.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Collagen and elastin synthesis",
    "Stem cell attraction to injury sites",
    "Gene expression reset (resets ~30% of genes to younger pattern)",
    "Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "1-2ml of 0.1% solution topical, or 200mcg injection",
    "range": "Topical or 100-500mcg SC",
    "notes": "Topical for skin/hair. Subcutaneous injection for systemic effects. Naturally present in plasma at ~200ng/ml in youth."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "Resets expression of ~30% of human genes toward a younger state (Pickart)",
    "Improved wound healing, skin thickness, and hair growth in clinical studies",
    "Plasma levels decline from 200ng/ml (age 20) to 80ng/ml (age 60)"
