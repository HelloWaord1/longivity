## Description
Flavonoid with senolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. Part of the dasatinib + quercetin senolytic cocktail studied at Mayo Clinic. Also used standalone for immune support, histamine management, and general anti-inflammatory benefits.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Senolytic (especially with dasatinib)
- Anti-inflammatory (NF-κB, COX-2)
- Antihistamine (mast cell stabilizer)
- Antiviral (zinc ionophore)

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 500-1000mg/day
- **Range:** 250-2000mg/day
- **Notes:** Poor bioavailability — use phytosome or liposomal form. As senolytic: 1000mg for 3 days monthly. As daily supplement: 500mg. Zinc ionophore — take with zinc for immune support.

## Key Findings
- Dasatinib + Quercetin cleared senescent cells in human clinical trial (Mayo Clinic)
- Reduced upper respiratory infections in athletes (meta-analysis)
- Potent zinc ionophore — enhances intracellular zinc for antiviral activity

## Interactions
- Antibiotics (quinolones — may reduce absorption)
- Blood thinners
- Cyclosporine
