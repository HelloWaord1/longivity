  "description": "Next-generation mTOR inhibitors and rapalogs designed for better tolerability than rapamycin. Includes everolimus (RTB101) and newer compounds specifically targeting mTORC1 over mTORC2 to reduce side effects while maintaining longevity benefits.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Selective mTORC1 inhibition",
