## Description
Endogenous fatty acid amide that acts on the endocannabinoid system without binding CB1/CB2 receptors. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic via PPAR-α activation and mast cell downregulation. Nobel laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini studied its neuroprotective properties.

## Mechanisms of Action
- PPAR-α agonism
- Mast cell downregulation
- Endocannabinoid tone modulation (entourage effect)
- Neuroinflammation reduction

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 300-600mg 2x/day
- **Range:** 300-1200mg/day
