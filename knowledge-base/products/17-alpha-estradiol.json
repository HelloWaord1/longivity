  "description": "Non-feminizing enantiomer of estradiol that extended lifespan in male mice in the NIA ITP. Unlike 17-beta estradiol, it does not activate classical estrogen receptors significantly, avoiding feminizing effects. Mechanism likely involves metabolic and hypothalamic pathways.",
  "mechanisms": [
    "Hypothalamic nutrient sensing modulation",
    "Hepatic lipid metabolism improvement",
    "Visceral fat reduction",
    "Non-classical estrogen signaling"
  ],
  "dosage": {
    "standard": "4.8-14.4 ppm in diet (mouse dose — human equivalent uncertain)",
    "range": "Under investigation",
    "notes": "NIA ITP positive in males only. Human dosing not established. Available as compounded pharmaceutical. Mechanism distinct from classical estrogen receptor activation."
  },
  "keyFindings": [
    "Extended lifespan 19% in male mice in NIA ITP (no effect in females)",
    "Did not feminize male mice — distinct from 17-beta estradiol",
    "Improved glucose tolerance and reduced visceral adiposity in male mice"
