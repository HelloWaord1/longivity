Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with unique PPAR-γ partial agonist activity. Beyond blood pressure control, activates metabolic pathways similar to caloric restriction. Among the longest-acting ARBs with 24hr coverage. Popular in longevity medicine even for normotensive individuals.

## Mechanisms of Action
- Angiotensin II receptor blockade
- PPAR-γ partial agonism (metabolic benefits)
- Insulin sensitivity improvement
- Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 20-40mg/day
- **Range:** 20-80mg/day

## Key Findings
- ONTARGET trial: comparable to ACE inhibitor ramipril for cardiovascular protection
- Unique PPAR-γ agonism improves insulin sensitivity — not seen with other ARBs
- Reduced new-onset diabetes by 30% compared to other antihypertensives

## Interactions
- Potassium supplements (hyperkalemia risk)
- NSAIDs (reduced efficacy)
- Lithium (increased levels)
- Other antihypertensives
