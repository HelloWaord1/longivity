# TruAge Epigenetic Test

**Category:** diagnostic
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
DNA methylation-based biological age test using the TruAge PACE (DunedinPACE) algorithm. Measures the rate of aging rather than just biological age. Considered one of the most validated epigenetic clocks for tracking intervention effects.

## Mechanisms of Action
- DNA methylation analysis at CpG sites
- DunedinPACE algorithm (rate of aging)
- Epigenetic clock calibration

## Dosage
- **Standard:** Blood draw, test every 3-6 months
- **Range:** Quarterly to annually
- **Notes:** Uses whole blood sample. DunedinPACE measures pace of aging (1.0 = normal, <1.0 = slower aging). Track trends over time.

## Key Findings
- DunedinPACE validated against 20-year longitudinal data (Dunedin Study)
- Predicts mortality, morbidity, and functional decline
- Responsive to lifestyle interventions within 6-12 months

## Interactions


## Side Effects
- Venipuncture discomfort
