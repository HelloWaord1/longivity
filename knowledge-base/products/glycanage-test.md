# GlycanAge Test

**Category:** diagnostic
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Biological age test based on IgG glycosylation patterns. Measures the glycan structures attached to immunoglobulin G, which reflect chronic inflammation and immune system aging. Complementary to epigenetic clocks.

## Mechanisms of Action
- IgG glycosylation analysis
- Inflammation status assessment
- Immune age measurement

## Dosage
- **Standard:** Dried blood spot, test every 3-6 months
- **Range:** Quarterly to annually
- **Notes:** Simple finger-prick dried blood spot. Measures glycan age (can be older or younger than chronological age). Responsive to lifestyle changes.

## Key Findings
- IgG glycans change predictably with age and inflammation
- Responsive to lifestyle interventions within 3-6 months (faster than methylation clocks)
- Validated across multiple cohorts (>100,000 individuals)

## Interactions


## Side Effects
- Finger prick discomfort

## Contraindications
- Active infection may skew results
