# Low-Dose Lithium (Pharmaceutical)

**Category:** pharmaceutical
**Evidence Grade:** C
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Lithium at sub-therapeutic doses (150-300mcg to 5mg) for neuroprotection and longevity, far below psychiatric doses (600-1200mg). Population studies show lower all-cause mortality and dementia rates in regions with higher lithium in drinking water.

## Mechanisms of Action
- GSK-3β inhibition
- Autophagy induction (TFEB activation)
- BDNF upregulation
- Neuroprotective — reduces neuroinflammation

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1-5mg lithium orotate daily
- **Range:** 150mcg-20mg/day
- **Notes:** Sub-therapeutic dose — NOT psychiatric dosing. Lithium orotate preferred (better CNS penetration at low doses). No blood level monitoring needed at these doses.

## Key Findings
- Higher lithium in drinking water associated with lower suicide, dementia, and all-cause mortality
- Extended lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila models
- Low-dose lithium reduced biomarkers of Alzheimer disease progression

## Interactions
- NSAIDs (increase lithium levels)
- ACE inhibitors
- Diuretics

## Side Effects
- Minimal at microdoses
- Mild thirst (occasionally)
- GI discomfort (rare)

## Contraindications
- Severe renal impairment
- Addison disease
- Brugada syndrome
