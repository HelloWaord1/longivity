  "description": "Eating aligned with circadian rhythm — typically finishing food 3+ hours before sleep and emphasizing earlier eating window. Distinct from caloric restriction. Satchin Panda's research shows circadian-aligned eating improves metabolic health independent of calorie reduction.",

    "standard": "10-12 hour eating window, finish 3hr before bed",
    "range": "8-12 hour window",
    "notes": "Satchin Panda protocol: 10hr window is sweet spot for most. Earlier eating preferred (insulin sensitivity higher in AM). Even without calorie change, metabolic benefits observed. Track with myCircadianClock app."
