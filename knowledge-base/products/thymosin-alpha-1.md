# Thymosin Alpha-1

**Category:** peptide
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** medium

## Description
A thymic peptide that modulates the immune system by stimulating T-cell maturation and function. FDA-approved as orphan drug (Zadaxin) for hepatitis B. Used clinically in over 30 countries for immunomodulation and shows promise for immune aging.

## Mechanisms of Action
- T-cell maturation and differentiation
- Dendritic cell activation
- NK cell enhancement
- Toll-like receptor signaling modulation

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 1.6mg subcutaneous, 2x/week
- **Range:** 0.8-3.2mg, 2-3x/week
- **Notes:** Subcutaneous injection. FDA orphan drug approval. Used clinically in 30+ countries.

## Key Findings
- Improved survival in sepsis and hepatitis B in multiple clinical trials
- Enhanced vaccine response in immunocompromised elderly patients
- Restored T-cell function in aging immune systems (immunosenescence)

## Interactions
- Immunosuppressants (may counteract)
- Other immunomodulators

## Side Effects
- Injection site reactions
- Mild flu-like symptoms (rare)

## Contraindications
- Organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressants
- Active autoimmune disease
