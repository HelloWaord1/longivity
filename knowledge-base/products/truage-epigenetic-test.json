  "description": "DNA methylation-based biological age test using the TruAge PACE (DunedinPACE) algorithm. Measures the rate of aging rather than just biological age. Considered one of the most validated epigenetic clocks for tracking intervention effects.",

  "dosage": {
    "standard": "Blood draw, test every 3-6 months",
    "range": "Quarterly to annually",
    "notes": "Uses whole blood sample. DunedinPACE measures pace of aging (1.0 = normal, <1.0 = slower aging). Track trends over time."
