# Peter Attia Longevity Framework

**Category:** protocol
**Evidence Grade:** B
**Risk Profile:** low

## Description
Evidence-based longevity framework by physician Peter Attia MD (author of "Outlive"). Focuses on the "four horsemen" of chronic disease prevention through exercise (Zone 2 + strength), metabolic health, sleep optimization, and emotional health. Emphasizes Medicine 3.0 — proactive rather than reactive healthcare.

## Mechanisms of Action
- VO2max optimization (strongest mortality predictor)
- Stability and strength training
- Metabolic health optimization
- Early cancer and cardiovascular screening

## Dosage
- **Standard:** 3-4hr/week Zone 2, 3-4 strength sessions, metabolic monitoring
- **Range:** Personalized based on biomarkers
- **Notes:** Framework detailed in "Outlive" (2023). Centering principles: exercise is the most powerful longevity "drug". Focus on healthspan not just lifespan.

## Key Findings
- VO2max in top quartile associated with 5x lower all-cause mortality
- Muscle mass/strength strongest predictor of mortality in elderly
- Early screening catches disease 10-20 years before symptoms
