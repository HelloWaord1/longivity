  "title": "Targeting age-related LINE-1 activation alleviates cardiac aging",
  "summary": "Nature Aging, Published online: 22 January 2026; doi:10.1038/s43587-025-01056-0LINE-1 retrotransposons are implicated in aging, but their role in cardiac aging specifically is not well understood. Here the authors show that LINE-1 expression rises in mouse hearts with age. Genetic LINE-1 derepression is accompanied by cGAS–STING activation and cardiac dysfunction, while pharmacological inhibition of LINE-1 or STING improves cardiac function in aged mice.",
