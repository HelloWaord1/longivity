  "title": "Next gen cancer drug shows surprising anti aging power",
  "summary": "A next-generation drug tested in yeast was found to extend lifespan and slow aging by influencing a major growth-control pathway. Researchers also uncovered an unexpected role for agmatinases, enzymes that help keep this pathway in balance. Diet and gut microbes may affect aging more than expected because they produce the metabolites involved.",
