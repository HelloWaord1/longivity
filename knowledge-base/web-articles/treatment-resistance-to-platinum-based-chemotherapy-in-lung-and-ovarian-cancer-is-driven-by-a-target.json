  "title": "Treatment resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in lung and ovarian cancer is driven by a targetable TGFβ senescent secretome",
  "summary": "Nature Aging, Published online: 03 February 2026; doi:10.1038/s43587-025-01054-2González-Gualda, Reinius et al. demonstrate that platinum-based chemotherapy-induced senescence promotes malignancy in ovarian and lung cancer via TGFβ ligands, with evidence in mouse models validated in clinical samples. Concomitantly blocking TGFβ signaling with chemotherapy reduces tumor burden and increases survival in mice.",
