  "title": "Considering Autophagy as a Means to Modestly Slow Aging",
  "summary": "Autophagy is the name given to a complex collection of processes responsible for identifying and recycling damaged or otherwise unwanted structures in the cell. Typically, a structure flagged for recycling is engulfed by an autophagosome, which is transported to and fuses with a lysosome, and the structure is broken down inside the lysosome by enzymes. An optimal level of autophagy for the maintenance of cell function only occurs in response to stress, including heat, cold, lack of nutrients, toxins, oxidative damage to important molecules, and so forth. Thus mild stresses that inflict relatively little damage to a cell can improve the function of cells, tissues, and organs, leading to a greater resistance to the damage and dysfunction of aging. Most of the well studied interventions […]",
