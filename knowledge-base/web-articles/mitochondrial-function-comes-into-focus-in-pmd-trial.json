  "title": "Mitochondrial function comes into focus in PMD trial",
  "summary": "PMD trial ties functional measures with NAD⁺ and redox biomarkers, offering a pragmatic view of mitochondrial modulation. Primary mitochondrial disease (PMD) rarely attracts broad attention outside specialist circles, yet it sits uncomfortably close to the fault lines of modern geroscience. When mitochondria fail, energy falters, redox balance skews and physical function degrades in ways that […] The post Mitochondrial function comes into focus in PMD trial appeared first on Longevity.Technology.",
