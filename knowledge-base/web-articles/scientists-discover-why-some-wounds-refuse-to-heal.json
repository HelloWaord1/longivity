  "title": "Scientists discover why some wounds refuse to heal",
  "summary": "Scientists have uncovered a surprising reason why some chronic wounds refuse to heal, even when treated with antibiotics. A common bacterium found in long-lasting wounds does not just resist drugs. It actively releases damaging molecules that overwhelm skin cells and stop them from repairing tissue. Researchers discovered that neutralizing these harmful molecules with antioxidants allows skin cells to recover and restart healing.",
