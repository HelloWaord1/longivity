  "summary": "Spermine, a small but powerful molecule in the body, helps neutralize harmful protein accumulations linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It encourages these misfolded proteins to gather into manageable clumps that cells can more efficiently dispose of through autophagy. Experiments in nematodes show that spermine also enhances longevity and cellular energy production. These insights open the door to targeted therapies powered by polyamines and advanced AI-driven molecular design.",
