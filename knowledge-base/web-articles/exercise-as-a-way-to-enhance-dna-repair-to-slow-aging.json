  "title": "Exercise as a Way to Enhance DNA Repair to Slow Aging",
  "summary": "In today's open access paper, researchers review the evidence for exercise to slow the aging of muscle tissue in part because it improves DNA repair mechanisms. How exactly damage to nuclear DNA contributes to aging beyond creating a raised risk of cancer remains a debated topic, despite recent conceptual advances. Nuclear DNA damage occurs constantly, near all of which is repaired. Yet the remaining damage largely occurs in genes that are not used or that are not all that important, and in cells with few replications remaining. Thus the ability to cause harmful alterations to cellular metabolism throughout a tissue was thought to be limited. The first way in which nuclear DNA damage could meaningfully impact aging is via somatic mosaicism. When mutations occur in […]",
