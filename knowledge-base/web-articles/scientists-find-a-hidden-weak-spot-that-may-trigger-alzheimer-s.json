  "title": "Scientists find a hidden weak spot that may trigger Alzheimer’s",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that a mutation tied to Alzheimer’s disrupts the production and quality of exosomes—tiny cell-made communication packets. Cells with the defective SORLA protein generate fewer exosomes and ones far less able to support nearby brain cells. This weakness may be a key driver of Alzheimer’s development. The research points to new treatment strategies that enhance or restore exosome function.",
