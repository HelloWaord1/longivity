  "title": "Scientists boost lifespan by 70% in elderly male mice using simple drug combo",
  "summary": "Scientists found that combining oxytocin with an Alk5 inhibitor revitalized extremely old male mice, boosting their lifespan and strength. Female mice showed only short-term improvements, highlighting a major sex difference in aging biology. The therapy restored youthful protein patterns in blood and targeted key pathways that drive tissue decline. Because the components are already clinically accessible, this approach could move toward human testing.",
