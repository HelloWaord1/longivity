  "summary": "The best thing that researchers can do with the presently established aging clocks, such as Phenotypic Age, is to gather as much data as possible on the relationship between the clock output and meaningful outcomes such as disease risk and mortality. Hence the existence of studies such as the one reported here. Even now, going on twenty years into the use of aging clocks, it remains unclear as to whether any of the existing, relative well-used clocks will produce a reasonable assessment of the effects of any novel potentially age-slowing or age-reversing therapy. An understanding of the links between what is measured in the clocks and the underlying processes of aging have not been established and will be very challenging to establish, and thus it […]",
