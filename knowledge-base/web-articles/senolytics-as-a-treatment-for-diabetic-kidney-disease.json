  "summary": "Type 2 diabetes is largely a self-inflicted problem, a consequence of becoming overweight. Aging makes it easier to reach the threshold needed for a diagnosis of diabetes, but the condition remains in principle avoidable for the majority of people, were they making better choices about diet and exercise. In recent years, researchers have linked an increased burden of cellular senescence to the pathology of type 2 diabetes; the aberrant diabetic metabolism encourages more cellular senescence, and the presence of lingering senescent cells is in turn inflammatory and disruptive to tissue function. In today's open access paper, researchers focus on cellular senescence in diabetic kidney disease. In this context the increased burden of senescent cells actively sabotages the function of the kidney. Thus senolytic therapies capable […]",
