  "title": "Dermatologists say collagen supplements aren’t the skin fix people expect",
  "summary": "Collagen pills sound like a shortcut to younger skin, but solid evidence doesn’t back them up. Higher-quality studies show little benefit, and your body doesn’t absorb collagen in the way ads suggest. Some supplements may even pose safety concerns and lack proper testing. Experts recommend focusing on proven habits like sunscreen, retinoids, and a nutrient-rich diet instead.",
