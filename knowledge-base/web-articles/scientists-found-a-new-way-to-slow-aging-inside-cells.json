  "title": "Scientists found a new way to slow aging inside cells",
  "summary": "A small tweak to mitochondrial energy production led to big gains in health and longevity. Mice engineered to boost a protein that helps mitochondria work more efficiently lived longer and showed better metabolism, stronger muscles, and healthier fat tissue. Their cells produced more energy while dialing down oxidative stress and inflammation tied to aging. The results hint that improving cellular power output could help slow the aging process itself.",
