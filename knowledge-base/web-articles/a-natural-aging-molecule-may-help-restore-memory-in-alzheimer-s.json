  "title": "A natural aging molecule may help restore memory in Alzheimer’s",
  "summary": "Researchers have found that a natural aging-related molecule can repair key memory processes affected by Alzheimer’s disease. The compound improves communication between brain cells and restores early memory abilities that typically fade first. Because it already exists in the body and declines with age, boosting it may offer a safer way to protect the brain. The discovery hints at a new strategy for slowing cognitive ageing before severe damage sets in.",
