  "title": "Alzheimer’s may trick the brain into erasing its own memories",
  "summary": "Alzheimer’s may destroy memory by flipping a single molecular switch that tells neurons to prune their own connections. Researchers found that both amyloid beta and inflammation converge on the same receptor, triggering synapse loss. Surprisingly, neurons aren’t passive victims—they actively respond to these signals. Targeting this receptor could offer a new way to protect memory beyond current amyloid-focused drugs.",
