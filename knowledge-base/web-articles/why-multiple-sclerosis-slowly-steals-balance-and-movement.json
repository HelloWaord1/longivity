  "title": "Why multiple sclerosis slowly steals balance and movement",
  "summary": "Many people with multiple sclerosis struggle with balance and coordination, and this study uncovers a hidden reason why. Researchers found that inflammation in the brain disrupts the energy supply of vital movement-controlling neurons. As their mitochondria fail, these cells weaken and eventually die, worsening motor problems over time. Protecting brain energy systems could open the door to slowing these symptoms.",
