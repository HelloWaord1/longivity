  "summary": "Researchers discovered that clogged brain “drains” show up early in people at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. These blockages, easily seen on standard MRI scans, are tied to toxic protein buildup linked to memory loss and cognitive decline. In some cases, they may signal Alzheimer’s earlier than other commonly used brain markers. This could help physicians detect the disease earlier, before irreversible damage sets in.",
