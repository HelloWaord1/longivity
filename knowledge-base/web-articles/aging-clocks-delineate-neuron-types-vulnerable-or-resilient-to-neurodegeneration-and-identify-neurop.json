  "summary": "Nature Aging, Published online: 03 February 2026; doi:10.1038/s43587-026-01067-5Gallrein et al. pair functional assays with clocks to compare chronological versus biological age of single neuron types in C. elegans, to probe their vulnerability or resilience to neurodegeneration, and use an in silico screen to identify neuroprotective drugs.",
