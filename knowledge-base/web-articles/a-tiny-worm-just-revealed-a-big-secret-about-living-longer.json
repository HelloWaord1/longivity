  "title": "A tiny worm just revealed a big secret about living longer",
  "summary": "Scientists studying aging found that sensory inputs like touch and smell can cancel out the lifespan-boosting effects of dietary restriction by suppressing the key longevity gene fmo-2. When overactivated, the gene makes worms oddly indifferent to danger and food, suggesting trade-offs between lifespan and behavior. The work highlights how deeply intertwined the brain, metabolism, and environment are. These pathways may eventually be targeted to extend life without extreme dieting.",
