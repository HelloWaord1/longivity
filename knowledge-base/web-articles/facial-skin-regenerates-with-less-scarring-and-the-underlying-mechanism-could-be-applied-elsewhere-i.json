  "title": "Facial Skin Regenerates with Less Scarring, and the Underlying Mechanism Could Be Applied Elsewhere in the Body",
  "summary": "Relative to skin elsewhere on the body, facial skin is less prone to scarring following regeneration from injury. Researchers have identified how this difference is regulated, and here demonstrate that they can influence the relevant mechanisms in order to reduce scarring during regeneration of skin injuries elsewhere on the body. It is also possible that further investigation of this biochemistry may yield approaches to reduce scarring more generally. This is of interest in the context of aging, as tissue maintenance becomes dysfunctional in many organs in ways that lead to excessive formation of disruptive small-scale scar-like structures. Surgeons have known for decades that facial wounds heal with less scarring than injuries on other parts of the body. This phenomenon makes evolutionary sense: Rapid healing of […]",
