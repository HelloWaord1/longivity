  "summary": "The balance of microbial species making up the gut microbiome changes with age. More inflammatory microbes win out over microbes that generate beneficial metabolites, and this contributes to degenerative aging. Restoring a more youthful composition of the gut microbiome has been demonstrated to improve health and extend life in aged animals. Human data for gut microbiome rejuvenation remains very sparse, however. That said, a growing body of observational data from human patients demonstrates that various age-related conditions correlate with an altered, pro-inflammatory gut microbiome. In particular, evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease - and the mild cognitive impairment that marks its earliest stages - correlate well with specific harmful alterations in the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome serves a central role in maintaining homeostatic balance or […]",
