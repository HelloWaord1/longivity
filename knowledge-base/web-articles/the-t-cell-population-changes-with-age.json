  "summary": "The immune system is made up of many specialized populations of cells. Even within well recognized categories such as T cells of the adaptive immune system, there are numerous subcategories, defined by surface markers, that exhibit meaningfully different behaviors. The example for today is γδ T cells, known to be involved in the clearance of senescent cells. Unlike other T cells, γδ T cells behave more like innate immune cells, able to attack pathogens and potentially harmful cells without the need for other components of the adaptive immune system to process antigens for recognition. The γδ T cell population is relatively poorly understood, but like the rest of the immune system, it changes with age in ways that are likely in part dysfunctional, in part […]",
