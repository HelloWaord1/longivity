  "title": "Scientists discover how hair cells can help heal skin faster",
  "summary": "Rockefeller scientists uncovered how hair follicle stem cells can switch from growing hair to repairing skin when nutrients run low. The key lies in serine, an amino acid that activates a stress signal telling cells to conserve energy. When both injury and low serine occur, stem cells fully pivot to skin repair. The discovery could lead to dietary or medical ways to boost healing.",
